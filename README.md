# Node-Ecosystem

Write an object validation module that exports a "validate" method that can, based on the inputs, validate whether or not an entity is satisfactory.

Things we want to be able to validate

Is the entity itself the right type (array, object, function etc)
All all "required" properties present and do they have values?
For any property that specifies a type, does the value match that type?
Testing
Validation Module

Test each method for proper/improper use (required params)
Validate that validation is reliable
Validate proper error conditions/returns
